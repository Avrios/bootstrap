# Avrios Fork of angular-ui-bootstrap

## Fix process

* Create a PR against `avr/develop`, and also the upstream if the fix could be useful to others
* Never rebase `avr/develop`, as then our `yarn.lock` on production may reference a commit that no longer exists
* Update the dependencies in our main app
